    //Is Y a Vowel?
    //Using the formal definition above, the letter Y in words like "hymn" and "shy" is also a vowel.
    // However, in words like "beyond" and "yes," Y is a consonant because the breath is partly obstructed.
    //
    //So, is Y a vowel? Well, sometimes it is, and sometimes it isn't, which is why it is often called a
    // semi-vowel. The argument for classifying Y as a consonant (which most do) is based on this:
    // When Y is a vowel, it is really just an I. When it is a consonant,
    //
    // it is being itself.
